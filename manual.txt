2.5 Letting make Deduce the Recipes
It is not necessary to spell out the recipes for compiling the individual C
source files, because make can figure them out: it has an implicit rule for
updating a ‘.o’ file from a correspondingly named ‘.c’ file using a ‘cc -c’
command.

4.3.3 The Function wildcard
a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and then link them
together could be written as follows:

    objects := $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))
    foo : $(objects)
        cc -o foo $(objects)

(This takes advantage of the implicit rule for compiling C programs, so there is
no need to write explicit rules for compiling the files)

4.13 Generating Prerequisites Automatically
use the ‘-MM’ flag

10.1 Using Implicit Rules
To allow make to find a customary method for updating a target file, all you
have to do is refrain from specifying recipes yourself. Either write a rule with
no recipe, or don’t write a rule at all. Then make will figure out which
implicit rule to use based on which kind of source file exists or can be made.
For example, suppose the makefile looks like this:

    foo : foo.o bar.o
        cc -o foo foo.o bar.o $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)

Because you mention foo.o but do not give a rule for it, make will automatically
look for an implicit rule that tells how to update it. This happens whether or
not the file foo.o currently exists.

10.2 Catalogue of Built-In Rules
Compiling C programs:
    $(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c

Compiling C++ programs:
    $(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c

Linking a single object file:
    $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) n.o $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS)
(if there are multiple object files, one of which has a name matching that of
the executable file)

A rule in the makefile tells Make how to execute a series of commands in order
to build a target file from source files. It also specifies a list of
dependencies of the target file. This list should include all files (whether
source files or other targets) which are used as inputs to the commands in the
rule.

  target: dependencies ...
    commands
    ...

If a target file is newer than all of its dependencies, then it is already up to
date, and it does not need to be regenerated. The other target files do need to
be updated, but in the right order: each target file must be regenerated before
it is used in regenerating other targets.

The make program uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times of
the files to decide which of the files need to be updated. For each of those
files, it issues the recipes recorded in the data base.

Example 1:

# an empty makefile

$ cat Makefile
$
$ make x  # goal name is basename of the source file
cc x.c -o x
$

Example 2:

# a rule without prerequisites and recipes, which just mentions the target

$ cat Makefile
x:  # target name is basename of the source file
$
$ make
cc x.c -o x
$

Example 3:

$ cat Makefile
x: x.o
$
$ make
cc -c -o x.o x.c
cc x.o -o x
$

Example 4:

$ cat Makefile
x: y.o z.o  # no mentioning x.o
$
$ make
cc -c -o y.o y.c
cc -c -o z.o z.c
cc x.c y.o z.o -o x
$

Example 5:

$ cat Makefile
x: y.o z.o x.o
$
$ make
cc -c -o x.o x.c
cc -c -o y.o y.c
cc -c -o z.o z.c
cc x.o y.o z.o -o x
$
